README
========================

So Github likes the idea of a README file, so here goes the unofficial first draft.


Building the source code for Reader is extremely simple at the moment. I use ant to
actually build my code but there's also a .project file for those who use Eclipse, 
you'll need to set your classpath for the android.jar. I am targeting android-7 so
I definitely recommend using 7, but the absolute minimum required target is 5.

Enjoy! Have any issues with it? File a bug at http://code.google.com/p/reader

Thanks!
